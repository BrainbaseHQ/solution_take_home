# Forward Deployed Engineer Take Home

## Overview

While Brainbase supports an extensive suite of 100+ built-in integrations, our legacy enterprise customers sometimes require tailored integrations with outdated software—often lacking robust documentation.

As a Forward Deployed Engineer, you’ll be at the forefront of prototyping, testing, and launching these custom integrations to our LLMs. You’ll turn incomplete API documentation, cryptic error logs, and ambiguous payload parameters into seamless, high-performance solutions - immune to the stochastic nature of LLMs and AI. Our customers demand unwavering accuracy, bulletproof reliability, and an absolute zero tolerance for 500 Internal Server Errors or failed requests.

## The Challenge

Brainbase has just signed a new customer, Based Airlines, who uses a legacy API to manage their flight bookings, fetch flight data, and upsell services provided by their partners (such as hotel rooms and rental cars).  

They have requested a chat bot where customers can come to book full flight itineraries, as well as add on services such as hotel rooms and rental cars.

Based Airline has requested that we use the [Amadeus](https://developers.amadeus.com/) API to take these actions.

All the customer was able to provide for context was this link:
https://developers.amadeus.com

Oh, and this video!...requesting that we skip to 1:23 for some inspiration:
